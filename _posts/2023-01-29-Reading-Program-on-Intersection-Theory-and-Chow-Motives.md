This is my plan of the reading program of the intersection theory and Chow motives.

<!--more-->

## -1. The timeline

Maybe **12/09/2022 -- 8/20/2023**.

## 0. Preliminaries we need
Including the basic theory of schemes and cohomology of coherent sheaves (such as R. Hartshorne's AG chapter 2,3), the basic theory of curves and a little bit surface theory.

## 1. The basic theory of algebraic cycles, Chow groups and intersection theory
+ **Chapter 1-18 in W. Fulton's Intersection Theory.** (see [Intersection Theory](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1700-8)).

**Here are my notes about examples and gaps in book:**

## 2. The basic theory of étale cohomology
Here are some notes I may read:

+ **Lectures on Etale Cohomology - J.S. Milne.** I will read the first part of this [notes](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LEC.pdf) (that is, before the proof of Weil's conjecture).

## 3. The basic theory of pure motives and Motivic Cohomology
### 3.1. Pure motives
+ **Lectures on the Theory of Pure Motives by Jacob P. Murre, Jan Nagel and Chris A. M. Peters.** (see [Lectures on the Theory of Pure Motives](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=ULECT/61)).

*Introduction:*

Motivic cohomology, originated from Deligne, Beilinson and Lichtenbaum and developed by Voevodsky, is a kind of cohomology theory on schemes. It admits comparison with étale cohomology of powers of roots of unity (Beilinson-Lichtenbaum), together with higher Chow groups, and relates to K-theory by Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.
In this lecture, we establish the category of motives in which the motivic cohomologies are realized. We explain its relationship with Milnor K-theory and Chow group, as well as the theory of cycle modules. Furthermore, we introduce cancellation theorem, Gysin triangle, projective bundle formula, BB-decomposition and duality.
