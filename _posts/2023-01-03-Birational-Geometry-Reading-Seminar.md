This is my plan of the reading program of birational geometry for the beginner of this area! Aiming to read the basic aspect in the birational geometry, both lower dimensional ($\dim X=2$) and higher dimensional ($\dim X\geq 3$) in algebraic geometry.

## -1. Our Notes
Here is our notes: [BirGeo23](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/my_notes/BirationalGeometry.pdf), update at 2023/03/07.

## 0. Preliminaries
Including the basic theory of schemes and cohomology of coherent sheaves at the level of Hartshorne's book chapter 1-4 and some reults in chapter 5.

## 1. The basic things in birational geometry
+ **The chapter 1-5 in Kollar/Mori's Birational Geometry of Algebraic Varieties.** These things including the most basic knowledge of birational geometry, including the minimal model program and its singularity theory.

Here are my remarks in the book:
 
> 1. [Some Remarks of the Kollar and Mori's Birational Geometry of Algebraic Varieties Chapter 1-2](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/2023/01/10/Some-Remarks-of-the-Kollar-and-Mori's-Birational-Geometry-of-Algebraic-Varieties-I/);
> 
> 2. [Some Remarks of the Kollar and Mori's Birational Geometry of Algebraic Varieties Chapter 3](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/2023/01/18/Some-Remarks-of-the-Kollar-and-Mori's-Birational-Geometry-of-Algebraic-Varieties-II/);
> 
> 3. [Some Remarks of the Kollar and Mori's Birational Geometry of Algebraic Varieties Chapter 4-5](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/2023/02/09/Some-Remarks-of-the-Kollar-and-Mori's-Birational-Geometry-of-Algebraic-Varieties-III-(The-End)/).

+ **Chapter 1-10 in Classification of Higher Dimensional Algebraic Varieties by Hacon/Kovács.** More recent book and MMP in Birational Geometry.


*More references:* (1) Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry by Olivier Debarre;

(2) Rational Curves on Algebraic Varieties by J. Kollár;

(3) Singularities of the Minimal Model Program by J. Kollár;

(4) Introduction to the Mori Program by Kenji Matsuki;

(5) Exercises in the birational geometry of algebraic varieties ([Kol08](https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2579)) by J. Kollár;

(6) Introduction to the log minimal model program for log canonical pairs by O. Fujino；

(7) Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I/II by R. Lazarfeld;

(8) Foundations of the Minimal Model Program by O. Fujino.

## 2. The BCHM
**Existence of minimal models for varieties of log general type by Birkar/Cascini/Hacon/McKernan.** The classical paper which shows that the canonical ring of a smooth projective variety is finitely generated.

*More references:* (1) Classification of Higher Dimensional Algebraic Varieties by Hacon/Kovács chapter 11-16;

(2) The Minimal Model Program for Varieties of Log General Type ([MMP](https://www.math.utah.edu/~hacon/MMP.pdf)) by Hacon;

(3) Foundations of the Minimal Model Program by Fujino.

## 3. Moduli of verieties of general type
**Families of varieties of general type by J. Kollár.** The moduli theory of KSBA-stable varieties of general type has been extended to higher dimension in full generality by contributions of many people, culminating in this book ([modbook-final](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~kollar/FromMyHomePage/modbook-final.pdf)). This theory heavily relies on developments in birational geometry, in particular, on existence of minimal models (BCHM) and boundedness of varieties of general type (Hacon/McKernan/Xu).

(3) Moduli of algebraic varieties by Caucher Birkar, [arxiv2211.11237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11237).

## 4. More things need to add
Such as BAB-conjecture or moduli of algebraic varieties by Caucher Birkar, [arxiv2211.11237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11237).
