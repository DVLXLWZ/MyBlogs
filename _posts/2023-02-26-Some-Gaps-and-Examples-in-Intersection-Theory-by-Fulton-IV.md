## Chapter 14. Degeneracy Loci and Grassmannians
### Section 14.1. Localized Top Chern Class
**Example 14.1.3.** Let $i:Z(s)\to Z(s\_2)$ and $j:Z(s\_2)\to X$, then we have

<body>
<p>
\begin{align*}
j_*i_*\mathbb{Z}(s)&=c_e(E)\cap [X]=c_{e_1}(E_1)c_{e_2}(E_2)\cap [X]\\
  &=c_{e_1}(E_1)\cap j_*\mathbb{Z}(s_2)=j_*(c_{e_1}(j^*E_1)\cap\mathbb{Z}(s_2)),
\end{align*}
</p>
</body>
</html>
as we need to show that $i\_* \mathbb{Z}(s)=c\_{e\_1}(j^* E\_1)\cap\mathbb{Z}(s\_2)$, we don't know is $j\_* $ injective?

**Example 14.1.5.** (a) We have

<body>
<p>
\begin{align*}
\deg\mathbb{Z}(s_f)&=\int_{\{t_1,...,t_n\}}\mathbb{Z}(s_f)=\int_Xc_n(f^*T_C\otimes T_X^{\vee})\\
  &=(-1)^n\chi(X)+(-1)^{n-1}\int_Xc_1(f^*T_C)c_{n-1}(T_X)\\
  &=(-1)^n\chi(X)+(-1)^{n-1}\int_Cc_1(T_C)\cap f_*(c_{n-1}(T_X)\cap [X]).
\end{align*}
</p>
</body>
</html>
As $f\_* (c\_{n-1}(T\_X)\cap [X])$ is $1$-cycle on $C$, it must of form $n[C]$. Pick a general fiber $X\_t$ with $t\in C$, we get $n=\int\_{X\_t}c\_{n-1}(T\_X\|\_{X\_t})=\chi(X\_t)$, hence we get

  &=(-1)^n\chi(X)+(-1)^{n-1}\chi(X_t)\int_Cc_1(T_C)\cap [C]=(-1)^n(\chi(X)-\chi(X_t)\chi(C)),
\end{align*}

and well done. $\blacksquare$

### Section 14.2. Gysin Formulas
Let $\underline{A}$ be a flag of vector bundles on $X$, i.e. $0\subsetneqq A\_1\subsetneqq\cdots\subsetneqq A\_d=A$.
Now we may want to define the flag bundle $Fl(\underline{A})$ as an $X$-scheme by a representable functor, if we define

  </script>
</head>
<body>
<p>
\begin{align*}
Fl(\underline{A})^{???}&:(Sch/X)^{opp}\to^{???}(Sets),\\
  &(f:T\to X)\mapsto^{???} \{D_1\subset\cdots\subset D_d:\dim D_i=i,D_i\subset f^*A_i\},
\end{align*}
</p>
</body>
</html>
then as the case of the Grassmannian we may **lost the functorial-property**, so may not that case!
Note that this is **NOT the triditional flag variety, so if we use the quotient definition, we can not guarantee the inclutions of $A\_i$**! So the only way is to consider the construction in the proof of Proposition 14.2.1.

> For the **triditional flag variety**, we can define that as follows:
>
> Consider the following results taken from [GT20][^2] Proposition 8.10:
>
> *Lemma.* Let $S$ be a scheme and let $i:\mathscr{U}\to\mathscr{E}$ be a morphism of $\mathscr{O}\_S$-modules. Consider the following statements:
>
> (a) The homomorphism $i$ is injective and $\mathscr{E}/\mathscr{U}$ is locally free;
>
> (b) For any scheme-morphism $f:T\to S$ the map $f* (i):f^* \mathscr{U}\to f^* \mathscr{E}$ is injective.
>
> If $\mathscr{U}$ is any $\mathscr{O}\_S$-module and $\mathscr{E}$ is quasi-coherent, then (a) implies (b); If $\mathscr{U}$ is of finite type and $\mathscr{E}$ finite locally free. Then (a) and (b) are equivalent. $\blacksquare$
>
> Hence we can using the quotient to give a functorial-property-well difinition of triditional flag variety:
> Given a sequence $(d\_1,...,d\_m)$ of positive integers of sum $n$ and fix a vector bundle $E$ over $X$ of rank $n$. A flag of type $(E;d\_1,...,d\_m)$ is $0=V\_0\subset V\_1\subset\cdots\subset V\_m=E$ of bundles in $X$ where $V\_j/V\_{j-1}$ is locally free of rank $d\_j$. Consider the functor $\mathrm{Flag}\_X(E;d\_1,...,d\_m):(Sch/X)^{opp}\to(Sets)$ as $(f:T\to X)\mapsto$ (type $(E;d\_1,...,d\_m)$ flags). Well done.

Over. $\blacksquare$

### Section 14.3. Determinantal Formula
**Theorem 14.3.** When we consider the *universal local case*, the birational morphism $\eta:Z(s\_{\sigma})\to\Omega(\underline{A},\sigma)$ plays an important role. To see that $\eta$ is birational, write down the elements of $\phi^{-1}(x)\cap Z(s\_{\sigma})$ for some $x\in X=\mathbb{A}^{ef}$. We find that this set will contain a single element if we remove the locus where the $\dim\ker\sigma(x)\|\_{A\_i(x)}<i$, that is, the locus where $(a\_i-i)$-minors vanishing in $\Omega(\underline{A},\sigma)$. $\blacksquare$

### Section 14.4. Thom-Porteous Formula
**Example 14.4.5.** 
Here we may assume that $C$ is a smooth curve over some $k$ as it is the same as Example 4.3.2/4.3.3.

As we get $0\to E\_d\to E\_m\to F\_t$, we may then let $m\geq 2g-1$ instead of $t\geq 2g-1$ as by Riemann-Roch theorem we have
\\[h^0(\mathscr{O}(mP\_0)\otimes\mathscr{L}\_x)=m+1-g+h^0(K\_C-mP\_0-\mathscr{L}\_x)\\]
and $\deg(K\_C-mP\_0-\mathscr{L}\_x)=2g-2-m$. But as $m=t+d$, then $t\geq 2g-1$ implies $m\geq 2g-1$.

Not that the $C$ of genus $g$ is of *general moduli* means that the point corresponding to the curve $C$ in the moduli space of genus $g$ curves $M\_g$ does not belong to denumerably many proper subvarieties. $\blacksquare$

**Example 14.4.7.**

**Example 14.4.12.** I don't know what's going on!

### Section 14.6. Grassman Bundles
**Example 14.6.2.**

**Example 14.6.4.** Why and how do we use this?

### Section 14.7. Schubert Calculus
**Example 14.7.7.** This is a standard example to use the Schubert calculus to deal with some simple algebraic geometry problems and we write this as a model.
Note that the first step is to deduce the relations of Schubert relations as Example 14.7.2.

(a) After checking the dimension of $[W\_C]$, we note that $[W\_C]=ag\_p+bg\_e$. Then by Example 14.7.1 we get
\\[a=\int\_{G\_1(\mathbb{P}^3)}[W\_C]\cap (0,3),b=\int\_{G\_1(\mathbb{P}^3)}[W\_C]\cap (1,2).\\]
Then we find that using the definiton of $(a\_0,...,a\_d)$ we get $a$ is just the apparent number $d$ of double points of $C$. Similarly, $b$ is the number of 2 points in whole $\deg C=n$ points over a general plane (by Bertini) and we get $b=\binom{n}{2}$.

(b) After analyze the geometry-meanings, we find that this is just \\[\int\_{G\_1(\mathbb{P}^3)}[W\_C]\cap[V\_{C\_1}]\cap[V\_{C\_2}]\\]
and using the relations in Example 14.7.2 and the results in Example 14.7.6.(a) we get the result.

(c) Similar as (b), we find that this is just \\[\int\_{G\_1(\mathbb{P}^3)}[W\_C]\cap[W\_{C'}]\\]
and well done. $\blacksquare$

**Example 14.7.11.** Need to think that why the hyperplane section of $G$ (in Plucker embedding) coorespond to the $n-d-1$-planes in $\mathbb{P}^n$?

**Example 14.7.12.(d).** How to compute $\int\_Xc\_1((A\_X^{\vee})^{\otimes 2}\otimes\mathscr{O}(1)\_X)^8=92$ and re-think the Example 3.2.22.

**Example 14.7.13.** This is a great result and for details of this we refer [3264EH][^3] Proposition 6.4. Here we give a sketch.

By the property of $S$, we have that the fiber of $S^{\vee}$ at $[L]\in G$ is the space of linear forms on $L$, that is $H^0(\mathscr{O}\_{P(L)}(1)$. Hence the surjection $E\_G^{\vee}\to L^{\vee}$ is the restrict of linear forms to $L$. Hence so is acting $\mathrm{Sym}^m$ to deduce the $m$-degree forms case. Now a degree $m$ hyperplane $X$ defined by a zero of section $g$ of $\mathrm{Sym}^mE^{\vee}$ which deduce a degree $m$ section $g'$ of $\mathrm{Sym}^mS^{\vee}$ by restriction. Hence the zero of $g'$ is the points $[L]$ in $G$ such that $g'\|\_{L}=0$. As $X$ is the zero of $g$, then these $L$ is the $d$-planes in $X$! $\blacksquare$
